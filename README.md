# Gender-Studies-Final-Project

The purpose of this project is to read through all the files in the "bin" folder and create a count for each of the words present. If you wish to run the program on your own, you are able to clone the repository to your local vscode and run the program. I have my own selection of words to count labelled "wordsToLookFor" which you can change to include whichever words you prefer to search for.
